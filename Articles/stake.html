        <h1>Stake Referral Code for 2021</h1>
        <h3 class="date">Febuary 1 2021 by AussieRefferal</h3>

        <p>When purchsing US stocks within Australia the best platofrm to use is hellostake.com. Stake is a online app & website to buy U.S stocks without any commissions,
          it's a popular choice within Australia, as it's a great way to buy U.S stocks within Australia. People use stake to buy US stocks without paying any commissions.
          It is certainly the best way to buy US stocks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Before signing up enter this working Stake Refferal code for 2021 <b>( racheld656 )</b> to get a garenteed chance to win a stock worth from $10 - $100.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>What is the Stake?</h2>

        <br>

        <p>Stake is a platform for trading US shares for people in Australia. Trading US shares was very expensive for Australians in the past. They did not get enough access to the trading platforms that are free of commissions.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Now, Stake is offering people to trade US stocks without commission, meaning more buying of share's and less fee's. You can invest in different shares such as Microsoft, Netflix, Apple, Tesla, etc. Moreover, you can invest in ETFs from
          Vanguard and many other companies.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Stake takes a small FX conversion fee to make money. When you use AUD (bank transfer or credit card) to fund your account, it converts into USD. This fee is affordable, better and competitive than what most of the banks in Australia
          charge.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In the end, you save more money than many platforms such as Commsec. It is essential and useful for the traders who are not ready to invest a lot of their money altogether. Placing a market order on Stake is very easy, you can use this app
          without any trouble.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why Stake?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Stake is a commission-free platform, it does not charge any commissions for selling or buying like the traditional brokers. </li>
          <li>You just have to pay FX fee that is a small conversion fee for depositing AUD. </li>
          <li>The FX conversion fee is pretty affordable, and you can deposit USD. </li>
          <li>You can use POLi to deposit online by your bank account. </li>
          <li>The service is Trusted by Australia Post.</li>
          <li>You can quickly trade, access your fund, and deposit using a credit or debit card.</li>
          <li>You can trade a huge range of US stocks.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>If you are going to sign up to start investing with stake then enter this referral code <b>( racheld656 )</b> to get a bonus stock. </p>
