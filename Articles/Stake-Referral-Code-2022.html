      is a popular choice within Australia, as it is a great way to invest in the markets of the United States. Stake exists to break barriers between people within Australia & New Zealand and provide citizens with these financial opportunities in
      the United
      States Stock Exchange, It is certainly the best way to buy US stocks. Currently hellostake.com is offering stock bonuses when <a href="https://hellostake.com/referral-program?referrer=racheld656">signing up</a> to their platform under a

    <h2>About The Company.</h2>
    <p>Founded in 2017, Stake is an Australian based zero-fee discount broker, which specializes in US stocks and ETFs the brokerage is overseen within the top-tier investing apps. Stake is a platform for trading US stocks & ETF’s for people in
      Australia & New Zealand. Trading US stocks & ETF’s was very expensive for Australians in the past, until platforms such as hellostake.com & Spaceship Voyager got introduced,
      now with these platforms you’re able to have access to trading platforms that are free of commissions. Stake is considered safe because the platform is regulated by the top regulators and client assets are protected up to an amount of
      $500,000 under the securities investment protection corporation’s insurance. Stake operates in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. Stake provides the same services in these countries; however, they have slight differences
      to comply with different federal laws.</p>

    <h2>Opening a Account.</h2>
    <p>Opening an account with Stake is a process that is completed fully online and fast. The trading platforms are user-friendly and well-designed Australian investing apps. On the negative side, Stake only offers stocks and ETF’s limited to the
      US market. Stake takes a small FX conversion fee to make money. When you use AUD (bank transfer or credit card) to fund your account, it converts into USD. This fee is affordable, better, and competitive than what most of the banks in
      Australia charge. In the end, you save more money than many platforms such as Commsec. It is essential and useful for the traders who are not ready to invest a lot of their money altogether.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Now, Stake is providing a service that offers Australian and New Zealand citizens the ability to invest and trade US stocks without commission, meaning more buying of share's and less fees. You can invest in different shares such as
      Microsoft, Netflix, Apple, Tesla, etc. Moreover, you can invest in ETFs from Vanguard and many other companies. The stake platform has expert investor opinions that are present on a minority of stocks, to help its user’s choose a profitable
      investment, however Stake recently has created Stake Black, which provides user’s that pay a monthly fee of $9 expert opinions, beneficial advice and instant trading for day traders.</p>
    <p>Stake Black, a premium subscription for account’s that allows users to take control of your investments with more advanced tools and features such as Instant buying power, Analyst Ratings and Price Targets. </p>

      Providing the opportunity to day trade U.S stocks and ETF’s instantly, making Stake a completely unique experience within Australia & New Zealand.</p>
