          now with these platforms you’re able to have access to trading platforms that are free of commissions. Opening an account with Stake is a process that is completed fully online and fast. The trading platforms are user-friendly and
          well-designed Australian investing apps. On the negative side, Stake only offers stocks and ETF’s limited to the US market. </p>

        <br>
        <p>Stake takes a small FX conversion fee to make money. When you use AUD (bank transfer or credit card) to fund your account, it converts into USD. This fee is affordable, better, and competitive than what most of the banks in Australia
