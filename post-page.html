        <h2 class="sub-heading">About Spaceship Voyager</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Spaceship Voyager is a Sydney-based investment app that manages your funds within two managed portfolios. Both of which invest in stocks from within Australia and outside. Spaceship Voyager's portfolio manages to perform a yearly return of 40% of your money according to last year's statistics.</p>
        <p class="post-text">This makes spaceship voyager a safe investment for people of all ages within Australia, as you’re usually going to get a high investment return by the end of the year. People may ask how you're able to invest in so many companies with the tiny starting amount of $5, when you invest in a portfolio with Spaceship Voyager, your money is pooled together with other investors on their platform. The money is then invested into the desired stocks you chose. This means using Spaceship voyager you're able to invest with fractional shares. </p>
        <p class="post-text">Whereas most investment apps ask you to choose from ETFs or individual stocks, spaceship voyager has taken a new approach, offering two managed funds: The index portfolio and the universe portfolio. </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Why spaceship Voyager?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">The platform is simple and very impressive due to the high-yearly return of your money. Spaceship Voyager has sparked my interest because it's a trusted safe micro-investing platform within Australia & located in Sydney.         </h2>
        <p class="post-text">I highly recommend this app as a way to get started investing before joining the stock market. I have had over 14% gains on my funds in the account without doing anything besides leaving the money inside the app. Spaceship Voyager has been very accessible and friendly to its customers with fast support, they’re constantly posting daily articles to educate its users who are new to investing. </h2>
        <p class="post-text">Being completely free for accounts with under $5,000 in their account this is the most impressive app on the market. </h2>
        
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Spaceship Voyager Summary</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Spaceship Voyager has an unbeatable fee structure with great stock picks for the two portfolios, which strive to have reasonably good returns.</p>
        <p class="post-text">The overall lack of options can make you feel like you don't have a solid hold on your finances. In that case, you should try setting up a trading account on a third-party website. This website is fantastic for any new or old investors who want to earn money on their invested funds without having to do the work. </p>
